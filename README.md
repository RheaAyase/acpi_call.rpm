# DKMS

This module is packed with dkms, available in Fedora. Works with [HHD](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/hhd-dev/hhd/). (You may need to reboot, or even reinstall HHD to get it to pick this up.)

Install from [copr repository](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/rhea/acpi_call/)
```
$ sudo dnf copr enable rhea/acpi_call
$ sudo dnf install acpi_call-dkms
